\textbf{\emph{Before you begin}}\\\\
This guide is tested on Ubuntu version 15.10 and 16.04 LTS, and it shall be valid to earlier versions too. Since some people from time to time have experienced problem with re-connection to wifi after wake-up-from-suspend, on version `` 16.04 LTS '', it's suggested that you make a fresh restart before this guide.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Make sure Wifi \& Networking are enabled as in screenshot:}

\noindent
\textbf{We will first find the `` CA certificate '', which is called `` GeoTrust\_Global\_CA.pem ''. It's located in the `` /etc/ssl/certs '' folder.}\\
Click at `` None '' will open a window with your `` Home '' folder. You then need to go to your root folder (as screenshot below) to access the `` etc '' folder and so on.\\\\
OBS: Choose only `` GeoTrust\_Global\_CA.pem '', NOT `` GeoTrust\_Global\_CA\_2.pem '' !!
